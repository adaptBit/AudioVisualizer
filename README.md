## Additional notes:

The audio visualizer is built with Web Audio API.  
The default background image is defaultBackground.jpg, which is located in the /plublic directory.  

## Troubleshooting:

If the audio visualization is not working, make sure that the music file is in a supported format (MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, OGG).  
If the background image is not showing up, make sure that the image file is in a valid format (PNG, JPG, JPEG).  
I hope this README.md file is helpful. Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback.
